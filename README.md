# Bootstrap-Portfolio

This profile page has been desgined primarily using Bootstrap. I have utilized Bootstrap libraries to use Navbar, jumbotron and cards to speed up the creation of this webpage. I have further used custom CSS to add extra styling. 

Bootstrap makes it much easier to apply content into different sections of a webpage as the code is readily available and easy to use. Using Bootstrap has also made it possible to minimze the use of media queries as bootstraps design enables responsive development of mobile-first websites. 

I started off with using a Bootstrap Navbar which I then styled using CSS. I then used a jumbotron for the hero section, portraying an image of myself and a quick description of who I am. Next, i used cards, utilizing the grid system of bootstrap, to display projects I have worked on so far. Then, the skills section as completed using the progress bar library in bootstrap. Cards again were used to portray a quick Bio section and Contact information. I finished off with a footer which includes links on different methods of contacting me. The HTML and CSS has been widely commented to easily identify different sections of the page.
